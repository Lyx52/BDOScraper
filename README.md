# BDOScraper
Item price and recipe scraper, scrapes prices from official marketplace but scrapes recipes from bddatabase
# Current feature set:
* Outputs prices/recipes to MongoDB
* Ability to calculate prices for some(Not all) recipes this is mainly because this script does not include item prices from npcs or tiered item categories(Blood 1, Blood 2 etc.)

# Current goals:
* Compile well built recipe database, so it nolonger needs to use scraping for recipes(Requires ugly code)
* Output recipe material prices to db
* API Work(Maybe in Node or maybe in python havent decided)
